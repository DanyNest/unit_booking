HI there, dear reviewer! I hope my teach task will find you Well!

1.First step - you should run docker
2.Second step - run docker-compose up -d
3.Third step - run app. Here we go! 
3.Swagger is available
4.Also if you want to check redis order status update faster - you can simply change value redis.status.timeout in properties
now it's 900 seconds(15 minutes)

ENJOY! AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!

Btw! Don't be scared by code style. I used google-formatter :)
